# Network-Inference-Survival-Analysis-of-Gene-Pairs
Methodology used for the manuscript "Gene Regulatory Network and Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Key Genetic Drivers in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma".
Network inference through sparse-group LASSO was applied to identify the features with significant effect sizes; further these features were subjected to MCMC simulation. MCMC simulation uncovered novel regulatory interactions within the ccRCC molecular landscape. Gene pairs from the previous steps with a significant effect in ccRCC were put through survival analysis for their prognostic relevance.
