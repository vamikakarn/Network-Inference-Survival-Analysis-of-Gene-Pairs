# Network-Inference-Survival-Analysis-of-Gene-Pairs
Methodology used for the manuscript "Gene Regulatory Network and Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Key Genetic Drivers in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma".
Network inference through sparse-group LASSO was applied to identify the features with significant effect sizes, further these features were subjected to MCMC simulation. MCMC simulation uncovered novel regulatory interactions within the ccRCC molecular landscape. Gene pairs from the previous steps with significant effect in ccRCC were put through survival analysis for their prognostic relevance.
